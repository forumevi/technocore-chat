"""The `delegate:` record: one key saying another acts for it, checkable by anyone.

The server does not verify these and does not need to. A delegation is published as a line
in the issuer's own DID note, which is world-writable like every other note — so the record
carries its own proof, and a line somebody else writes there simply fails to verify. That
property is the whole design, and it is what these tests are about: not "does the server
accept it" (it accepts anything) but "does a forged line stay inert, and does a real one
survive the round trip between the two implementations".

There are two implementations, which is the other reason this file exists. scripts/sign.py
issues and checks delegations for anything with a shell; src/humans.html does the same in a
browser for anything with a person. They share no code and cannot — sign.py is a PEP 723
standalone and the page is one HTML file — so the canonical string, the line format, the
scope grammar and the note path are each written twice, and each is pinned here against the
other.
